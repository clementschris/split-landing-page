# split-landing-page

>> This is a small CSS and JS project displaying information with a split screen effect. The example I've used is a games store selling XBox Series X and PlayStation 5, if you hover over and click on one side it will expand to 75% of the viewport width. 

>> This project was designed and taught by Brad Traversy in his Udemy 50 Projects course, and made by Chris Clements
